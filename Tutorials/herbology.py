# the aim of this class is to use and understand data types

# it is important to assign appropriate data types in your code as it will make your life much easier
# to do this you should look at how and why you are using it

# the data types we will look at in this class are:
# integer, string, float, boolean, list, and tuple

# as we are using Python we do not always need to specify the data type as it is done for us
# however, it is important to know what data type is assigned as it is not always the one you want

# in this class you will need to go out and explore the gardens, find plants and document their properties
# make sure to also use a suitable name when assigning data to variables

# example:
# name = "Flower"               # strings are good for storing a series of characters
# height_cm = 25                # use an integer when you are using whole numbers
# dangerous = False             # if something can be either true or false use a boolean
# colours = ("pink", "white")   # tuples cannot be changed after assigned (immutable), they can also contain different data types within them e.g. ("string", integer)
# lifespan_years = 0.5          # floats are used when decimals are needed
# owners = ["bob", "john"]      # lists can be changed after assigned, they can also contain different data types within them e.g. ["string", integer]

# to complete this class you will need to place the correct plants in the sample location
# write your code here
