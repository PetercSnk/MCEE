# the aim of this class is to use and understand 1d and 2d arrays

# a 1-dimensional array is a single array ([x, y, z])
# a 2-dimensional array is where you have arrays within an array ([[x1, y1, z1], [x2, y2, z2]])

# lets first use a 1d array
# the checkered grid is 10 blocks across, so our 1d array only needs to contain 10 elements
# we will fill our array with 0s and 1s where a 1 will signal that a block should be placed
# the idea is to use the array to plot a constellation

# for our 1d array only one for loop is needed
