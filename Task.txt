Technocamps Islands

Using Minecraft for Education, create islands that will allow users to explore core computational 
thinking theories and methods through play. The islands should include a range of interactive activities 
and supporting educational materials that will engage and encourage children and young people to explore
computer science as an option at GCSE and beyond. The islands will need to align with the new 2022 Welsh
curriculum for science. This includes all elements of CS and can be adapted for teaching cyber security.
